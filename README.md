# Islanders-Recreation
University project  for " OOP  Design Patterns" course at INSA Rennes.
This project was done by a group of 3 students during half a semester.

The goal was to create a website letting you play a basic recreation of the "[Islander](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/)" game.

The back-end was made in JAVA.
Where as our front-end is using Angular (hence typescript) with mostly the Angular Material library.
